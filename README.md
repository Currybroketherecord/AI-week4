## 🧠 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

Sorts a list of dictionaries by a specified key using:
- GitHub Copilot suggestion (`.get()` based)
- Manual implementation for comparison

Includes runtime demonstration and sample data for evaluation.

---

## 🧪 Task 2: AI-Based Automated Testing

Simulates login testing logic based on a conceptual Testim.io setup. Tests:
- Valid credentials → dashboard loaded
- Invalid credentials → error triggered

Highlights benefits of AI-based test coverage and edge-case detection.

---

## 🔮 Task 3: Predictive Analytics with ML

Uses Kaggle’s Breast Cancer dataset to train a Random Forest model that labels diagnostic severity as priority levels (`high`, `low`). Includes:
- Preprocessing
- Model training
- Accuracy and F1 score metrics

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-devops-assignment.git`

2. Navigate to a task folder:  
   `cd ai-devops-assignment`

3. Run the script using Python:  
   `python task1_code_sorting.py`  
   _(Ensure you have pandas and sklearn installed for Task 3)_
